# Ten Drops

I would like to introduce my pygame project, [Ten Drops](https://github.com/chyok/ten-drops) - a fun and addictive water droplet game built using Pygame-CE. This game is a loving tribute to the classic Flash game "Splash Back," reimagined for modern platforms.

## What is Ten Drops?

Ten Drops is a simple yet engaging game where players click on water droplets to make them explode, with the goal of clearing the screen. It's a perfect blend of strategy and quick reflexes that will keep you entertained for hours.

## Key Features
1. Simple, intuitive gameplay
2. Colorful water droplet graphics
3. Inspired by the beloved Flash game "Splash Back"
4. Built using Pygame-CE for smooth performance

## How to Play
The objective is straightforward - click on the water droplets to make them burst. Keep clicking until you've cleared all the droplets from the screen. It's easy to learn but challenging to master!

## Installation:
You can easily install Ten Drops using pip:

```
pip install ten-drops
```

Once installed, simply run:

```
ten-drops
```

For Windows users, I've also provided a binary file that can be directly executed to play the game.

## Future Plans
I'm continually working on improving Ten Drops and adding new features. Some ideas I'm considering include:
- Multiple difficulty levels
- A scoring system
- Sound effects and background music
- Power-ups and special droplets

## Conclusion
Ten Drops is more than just a game - it's a nostalgia trip for those who remember the Flash era and a fun, accessible entry point for new gamers. Whether you're looking for a quick distraction or a new coding project to contribute to, Ten Drops has something for everyone.
